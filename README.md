## Thanks to

Well, the biggest effort was made by
[Jonathan Warner](http://jaxbot.me/articles/zero_downtime_nodejs_reloads_with_clusters_7_5_2013)
who explained how easily you could achieve ZDD
with node.

We polished the code a bit as we found out
that it had some glitches but the main idea remains
the same (so yeah, thanks Jax!).
